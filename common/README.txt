this directory used to have 'common' code such as audio mixing, note generation, wave creation, etc. that was used as a starting library for the final project. functionality in this folder was partially implemented as homework assignments for the class this project was built for. therefore, to prevent current students from using existing public implementations of these common libraries, this code has been removed.

if you would still like to use interval for whatever reason, please contact joonhoko513@gmail.com for a zipped copy of the common directory.
