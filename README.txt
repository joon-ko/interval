this folder used to be a directory of 'common' code such as audio mixing, note generation, wave creation, etc. that was included as a starting library when building the final project.

because this is a public repository, we do not wish to allow current students of the class this project was for to rely on complete implementations of functionality in the 'common' directory as solutions to homework assignments.

if you would still like to use interval as a non-current-student, please reach out to joonhoko513@gmail.com for a zipped copy of the common code library.
